# data-combine ![logo](datacombine/datacombine/static/pictures/data_combine_logo_smaller.png)

The data management solution for the Youth and Young Adult Network of the
National Farmworker Ministry in Orlando; which is the best, most lit, most
radical of all the YAYA's.

## Version 0.0.0001: Codename <Insert-Codename Here>

### PLACEHOLDER TEXT...just playin'

Yeah, this is more alpha than Alex Jones on SUPER SUPER MALE VITALITY pills.
The program is a barely configured Django-server, with a bash script to setup
a postgres server (which has been tested on ubuntu Docker containers, and does
exactly what I just wrote). There is also a python module to mine the dumb High
Rise text files which constitute their "download all contacts".

Also, can connect to Constant Contact and harvest all the contacts, so that we
can work with the data locally, and not have to mess with CC any more than we
have to.

So yeeeeeeah, that's what it is right now, but it's gonna be more bad ass than
a donkey prison, y'all!
